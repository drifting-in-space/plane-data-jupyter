# jamsocket-jupyter-notebook
Base repo for running Jupyter Notebooks on the Jamsocket platform

## Steps

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your notebook(s) to the `/notebook` directory.
3. Add your notebook's python dependencies to `requirements.txt` (alternatively, if you prefer `pipenv`, add them with `pipenv install` and then run `pipenv run freeze`).
4. Replace `/notebooks/hello-jamsocket.ipynb` in `Dockerfile` with the path to the notebook you'd like to be automatically loaded. If you want the user to see a file listing of the `/notebooks` directory by default, remove that line entirely.
5. Run `./freeze.sh` to create a `freeze.txt` file from `requirements.txt`. This pins the version of all of the dependencies of the libraries in `requirements.txt`.
6. Set your account name as the `JAMSOCKET_ACCOUNT` value in your GitHub secrets.
7. Generate an access token at [app.jamsocket.com/settings](https://app.jamsocket.com/settings) and set it as the `JAMSOCKET_TOKEN` value in your GitHub secrets. ([Sign up](https://auth.jamsocket.com/signup) for a Jamsocket account if you donâ€™t already have one.)
8. Push your repo to your GitHub account, and your Jupyter Notebook container will be automatically built and pushed to Jamsocket.
9. Get a Spawn URL from us. (Open this URL in a browser to start a new notebook instance.)

## To run the jupyter-notebook locally for testing:

```bash
docker build -t jupyter-notebook .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env PORT=8080 -it jupyter-notebook
open localhost:8080
```
